# ReactPoC
React with Spring POC
Both the applications are running in localhost 
To avoid cross orgin conflict open chrome with this run command
chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security
open both localhost:8080/users and localhost:3000 in this chrome window to get the data from the spring boot application to react app 

NOTE:This process is applicable only when both apps run in localhost
